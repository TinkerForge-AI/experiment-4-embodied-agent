rules make me think that the agent wont learn from its mistakes.

the finite state machine is excellent. we can start with a small number of states, and introduce more as we notice states that the agent COULD benefit from having based on their observations and evolution. for example, "I am exploring" and then they observe a non-player character, then they either decide to become "afraid" or "interactive" or "cautious" or "aggressive" based on observations over time (probably reacting to observations over a period of time, not just on the first observation!)

i'll need some more explanation on utility scoring. will this be assigned by us as the system designer or by the agent? also, how is utility even defined? based on the various stimuli the system receives? this almost leads me to believe there may be some sort of way for us to extrapolate what the agent "likes" and "dislikes" in an odd way. this could yield some interesting research and potentially take us down a path where we can design likes and dislikes..... i'm intrigued!

prediction is also interesting, I suppose we do this as humans, too. I am parking my car, so I know in a few more logical steps I will be inside the house, or I am running towards a cliff and I am either going to run off of it or slow down to a stop, or change directions.... a variety of situations should definitely yield a decision tree of actions.

we definitely need to leverage an appropriate reinforcement learning technique, but I am still not entirely sure of the idea of "reward" as this has led to reward hacking in LLM's. thinking about humans, we are always pleasure seeking and always pain avoiding --- so this is a strong mechanism, but the idea of "utility" might be enough to surpass a typical reward function... we'll have to explore this (it coincides with previous experiments we've run)

behavior trees make sense, and maybe we "seed" and plan out these trees for the agent by supervising it at first, but then we allow it to expand this tree on it's own?

Copilot:

Great reflections! Here’s a concise breakdown to address your questions and ideas:

Utility Scoring Explained
Who assigns utility?
Initially, the system designer can assign utility scores to actions based on expected desirability (e.g., “move toward light” = +5, “touch fire” = -10).
As the agent evolves, it can learn to adjust these scores based on experience (reinforcement learning, preference learning, etc.).

How is utility defined?
Utility is a numerical value representing how “good” an action is in a given context.
It can be based on:

Sensory stimuli (e.g., sound, color, proximity)
Internal states (e.g., hunger, curiosity)
Past outcomes (learning from mistakes/successes)
Likes and dislikes:
Yes! Utility can model likes/dislikes. Over time, the agent can learn to prefer actions that lead to positive outcomes and avoid those with negative ones.

Prediction & Planning
Agents can use models to predict future states and choose actions that maximize expected utility (not just immediate reward).
This is similar to how humans anticipate consequences and plan several steps ahead.
Reward vs. Utility
Reward is often externally defined and can be gamed (“reward hacking”).
Utility can be more flexible, internal, and context-sensitive—potentially leading to more robust, human-like decision-making.
Behavior Trees & Expansion
Seeding initial behaviors and allowing the agent to expand its tree autonomously is a promising approach.
Supervision can guide early learning, then the agent can generalize and innovate.
Next Steps:

Prototype a finite state machine agent with utility-based action selection.
Experiment with dynamic utility adjustment (learning likes/dislikes).
Explore prediction/planning modules.
Consider hybrid approaches (FSM + utility + behavior trees).

Given the inherent biases we would be placing on "move toward light" or "touch fire", we would also want a control experiment / agent profile. We could see how the initial utility we establish with the agent might impact it's learning and later behaviors. We might find out that the impact is infinite, however, and that it's difficult to cause such a complex system to learn as desired, also.

if utility does translate to likes and dislikes, we should be able to see for ourselves visually how these utility scores translate to utility scores! This might solve the problem of alignment, potentially! if we can tie utility to moments in time (actual visual / audio / keyboard / mouse actions) and view them as video ---- this could be ground-breaking for insights!

predicting future states might help our agent choose the right action, which is very cool! i would like to see the agent plan several steps ahead, and maybe even somehow deliver it's thought process in text form (like thinking out loud!) This will only be possible AFTER we feel the embodied agent has learned the English language, however.... and we have to hope that they don't just learn fantasy / sci-fi words and end up completely useless as LLM models / AI agents!!

Reward vs utility is really profound, in my eyes. learning the UTILITY of something means you're planning for future interactions with it, which to me sounds like "reasoning" in an odd way. The agent would not simply treat a reward like a "drug" where you are fixated on your next "reward".

What do you think?

Your thinking is spot-on and aligns with current research in embodied AI and agent alignment.

Biases & Control Profiles:
Yes, initial utility assignments act as “priors” and can strongly shape agent behavior. Running control experiments—with different utility profiles or even random utilities—can reveal how much these biases persist or are overcome by learning. This is a powerful way to study alignment and emergent preferences.

Visualizing Utility Over Time:
Tying utility scores to specific moments (actions, observations) and visualizing them (e.g., overlaying scores on video or timelines) would provide deep insight into agent reasoning and alignment. This could help diagnose misalignment or reward hacking, and show how “likes/dislikes” evolve.

Prediction & Planning:
Agents that plan ahead (using models of the environment) are more robust and “reasoning”-like. Having the agent “think out loud” (e.g., logging its predicted future states and chosen actions) would make its decision process transparent and interpretable. This is especially valuable for debugging and trust.

Reward vs Utility:
You’re right—utility-based reasoning is more nuanced than simple reward maximization. It encourages agents to consider long-term consequences and context, not just immediate gratification. This is closer to human reasoning and less prone to reward hacking.

Language & Thought Process:
Once the agent has a grasp of language, having it narrate its reasoning (“I see a cliff, so I’ll slow down”) could bridge the gap between symbolic and embodied intelligence. This also aids interpretability and alignment.

Summary:

Control experiments are essential for understanding bias and alignment.
Utility visualization is a breakthrough for agent transparency.
Planning and “thinking out loud” make agents more interpretable and robust.
Utility-based reasoning is a promising alternative to reward maximization.
Next Steps:

Prototype utility logging and visualization.
Design control agent profiles.
Scaffold agent “thought process” logging.
Experiment with planning modules.
