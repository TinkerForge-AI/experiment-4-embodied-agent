## Eastshade Agent Integration Workflow

### 1. Game Installation & Launch
- Purchase and install Eastshade via Steam.
- Ensure the game runs reliably on your target system (Linux, Windows, etc.).
- Document game launch parameters (windowed mode, resolution, etc.) for consistent agent interaction.

### 2. Window Management & Focus Detection
- Use OS-level APIs (e.g., X11 for Linux, pywin32 for Windows) to:
  - Detect when Eastshadeâ€™s window is open and in focus.
  - Bring the game window to the foreground as needed.

### 3. Input Capture & Injection
- **Visual Input:**  
  - Use screen capture libraries (e.g., OpenCV, mss) to grab frames from the Eastshade window.
- **Audio Input:**  
  - Use sounddevice + scip or similar to capture system/game audio.
- **Keyboard/Mouse Input:**  
  - Use pynput, pyautogui, or OS hooks to both capture and inject keyboard/mouse events.
  - Map agent actions to game controls (movement, interaction, menu navigation).

### 4. Synchronization & Buffering
- Timestamp all inputs and actions.
- Buffer data to ensure synchronized multi-modal observations for the agent.

### 5. Agent-Environment Interface
- Develop a wrapper or API that exposes:
  - Observations (visual, audio, keyboard, mouse) to the agent core.
  - Action execution (sending keyboard/mouse commands to the game).
  - State monitoring (window focus, game state, intervention detection).

### 6. Data Logging & Monitoring
- Log all agent actions, environmental states, and system events.
- Monitor resource usage and performance.

### 7. Safety & Intervention
- Implement mechanisms to pause/stop agent control if human intervention or unexpected game states are detected.

### 8. Testing & Validation
- Run scripted sessions to validate input/output integration.
- Collect and review sample data before enabling full autonomous training.

**Next Steps:**
- Choose and prototype libraries for screen/audio capture and input injection.
- Build a minimal agent-environment interface for initial testing.
- Document all technical dependencies and configuration steps.
