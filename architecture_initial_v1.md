## Modular Architecture Overview

The embodied agent framework is designed with modularity and extensibility in mind. Each module is responsible for a distinct set of functions, enabling parallel development, testing, and future upgrades. The architecture supports clear separation of concerns and facilitates collaboration across engineering, research, and operations teams.

### Language Learning Integration (Future Consideration)

- The framework should support optional modules for language-based learning, including:
  - Traditional LLM training (text corpus ingestion, supervised/unsupervised learning).
  - Interactive language experiences (chatting with an LLM, in-game dialogue, multi-modal communication).
- The agentâ€™s openness and adaptability to language learning should be measured through defined evaluation metrics (e.g., task performance, behavioral change, retention).
- The system must support safe experimentation:
  - Ability to snapshot and restore agent weights/states before and after language learning interventions.
  - Logging and analysis tools to compare agent performance and traits pre- and post-language exposure.
- Research teams should carefully monitor for adverse effects (e.g., reduced generalization, confusion, behavioral drift) and be able to revert to previous agent states if needed.

### Core Modules

1. **Input Orchestration Module**
   - Captures and synchronizes sensory inputs: screen (visual), audio (auditory), keyboard/mouse (kinesthetic).
   - Buffers and timestamps all input streams.
   - Routes inputs exclusively to the agent core.

2. **Environment Interface Module**
   - Manages integration with simulation/game environments.
   - Handles window focus, size, and state detection.
   - Provides standardized APIs for environment interaction.

3. **Agent Core Module**
   - Implements agent logic: observation processing, action selection, reward calculation, and memory management.
   - Supports real-time training and inference.
   - Interfaces with curriculum and evaluation modules.

4. **Curriculum Management Module**
   - Enables scenario creation, modification, and replay.
   - Supports curriculum scheduling and progression.
   - Facilitates environment diversity and social interaction scenarios.

5. **Intervention & Data Integrity Module**
   - Detects human intervention, screen changes, and window events.
   - Pauses or stops training as needed, logs all interruptions.
   - Ensures clean, uncontaminated training data.

6. **System Monitoring Module**
   - Tracks resource usage (CPU/GPU/RAM).
   - Logs performance metrics, lag events, and system health.
   - Provides alerts for critical resource thresholds.

7. **Logging & Analytics Module**
   - Centralizes event, decision, and metric logging.
   - Supports post-hoc analysis of agent behavior and trait emergence.
   - Enables data export for research and reporting.

8. **Evaluation & Extensibility Module**
   - Defines and computes agent performance metrics.
   - Supports integration of new agent architectures, input types, and multi-agent scenarios.

### Inter-Module Communication

- All modules communicate via well-defined APIs and message passing.
- Logging and monitoring are cross-cutting concerns, accessible by all modules.
- Modules are designed for plug-and-play extensibility, allowing future upgrades with minimal disruption.
