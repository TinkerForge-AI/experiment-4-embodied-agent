## High-Level Workflow for Agent Training & Input Coordination

1. **Environment & Game Selection**
   - Commit to agent training on a specific game/environment.
   - Configure environment parameters and ensure compatibility with the framework.

2. **Window Management & Focus Detection**
   - Launch the game and verify the game window is open and in focus.
   - Test and validate window focus detection logic to ensure agent only acts when appropriate.

3. **Agent Control Validation**
   - Test agent’s ability to send keyboard and mouse instructions to the game window.
   - Confirm that all control signals are correctly received and executed by the game.

4. **Input Capture System Validation**
   - Test the system’s ability to capture and synchronize all sensory inputs (screen, audio, keyboard, mouse).
   - Validate buffering, timestamping, and data integrity for each input stream.

5. **Test Data Collection & Validation**
   - Run a short, scripted session to collect sample data.
   - Validate that captured data is accurate, complete, and suitable for training.

6. **Intervention & Safety Checks**
   - Ensure mechanisms are in place to detect human intervention, window state changes, or unexpected events.
   - Confirm that training pauses or stops as needed and logs all relevant events.

7. **Continuous Learning Activation**
   - Once all systems are validated, hand over control of inputs to the agent.
   - Start the agent’s continuous learning and training loop.

8. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Continuously monitor system performance, resource usage, and input synchronization.
   - Log all agent actions, environmental states, and system events for later analysis.
